Soluation of below 2 question:-
1. Write code to find possible combinations that lead to specific sum.
Definition: Given an array of positive integers arr[] and an integer x, The task is to find all unique
combinations in arr[] where the sum is equal to x.
The same repeated number may be chosen from arr[] an unlimited number of times. Elements
in a combination (a1, a2, ..., ak) must be printed in non-descending order. (ie, a1 <= a2 <= ... <=
ak). If there is no combination possible print “Empty”.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = 2, 4, 6, 8, x = 8
Output:
```
[2, 2, 2, 2]
[2, 2, 4]
[2, 6]
[4, 4]
[8]
```


2. Write code to create patterns as described below.

Definition: You need to take an integer input and then draw the pattern according to it.
Examples:
Input: 5
Output:
```
        A
      B A B
    C B A B C
  D C B A B C D
E D C B A B C D E
```
